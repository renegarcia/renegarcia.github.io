Next January the 16th I will be delivering a talk about the volume of the moduli space of vortex-antivortex systems on compact manifolds at the school of mathematics, Autonomous University of Yucatan, Mexico. Talk is free and will be delivered in spanish.

## Abstract

This is a talk about a problem in abelian field theory, which corresponds to the O(3)-Sigma model. In this model it is assumed that there is a matter field with a spin-like internal structure, i.e. a vector field of unit length on space. As in all field theories, there is a set of partial differential equations that determine the solution space. For the O(3)-Sigma model the set of parameters is finite and is interpreted as the position of virtual particles whose dynamics is directed by a Riemannian metric. The domain of the equations we study is a compact Riemann surface, and as a consequence of the field equations, the metric is of Kahler-type.

The geometry of this model was studied in depth by Romao and Speight, who under some assumptions found a formula for the volume of the moduli space of solutions. I will delve into the geometry of moduli space, to explain the conjecture and the progress that has been made to demonstrate it in some cases.
