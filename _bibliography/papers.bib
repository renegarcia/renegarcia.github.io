  abstract={Existence of abelian BPS vortices on a manifold with boundary satisfying Neumann boundary conditions is proved. Numerical solutions are constructed on the Euclidean disk, and the L2-metric of the moduli space of one vortex located at the interior of a rotationally symmetric disk is studied. The results presented extend previous work of Manton and Zhao on quotients of surfaces that admit a reflection.}

This establishes, in a rigorous setting, a longstanding informal conjecture of Baptista and Manton.},
