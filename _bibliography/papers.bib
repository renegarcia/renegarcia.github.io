  abstract = {It is proved that the normalized L2 metric on the moduli space of n-vortices on a two-sphere, endowed with any Riemannian metric, converges uniformly in the Bradlow limit to the Fubiniâ€“Study metric. This establishes, in a rigorous setting, a longstanding informal conjecture of Baptista and Manton.}
