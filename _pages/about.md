Welcome to my homepage, I am  a postdoctoral research at National Autonomous University of Mexico, where I work on _differential geometry_ and _mathematical physics_ applied to a variety of problems. Details can be found on my [publications page](/publications). I keep notes of the topics I find interesting, these are freely available at the following links:

* [Gists.](https://gist.github.com/renegarcia)
* [Notes.](https://renegarcia.github.io/dendron)

I am also an enthusiast of computer science and entrepenurship, specially regarding the art of solving data related problems for the industry, links to some of my projects can be found [here](/projects).

I try to keep up to date my media presence, but time has proved me this is a NP task, if you are curious about any of the topics I work in, in the academia or elsewhere, please contact me by social media (links at the bottom of the page) or [drop me a line](mailto:rene.garcia@correo.uady.mx)
